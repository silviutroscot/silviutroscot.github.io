### Background

Born in [Ramnicu-Sarat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A2mnicu_S%C4%83rat), Romania, where I lived for 18 years and I developed my interest in sciences and maths, but also in football, politics and listening to stories.<br/>
Between 2016 and 2020 I studied Computer Science at [The University of Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Manchester) I was an intern at Seers CRM, Twitter, Bloomberg and Microsoft, where I gained a better image of the tech industry and I had the chance to work with great engineers and experience different work environments.
Until the beginning of 2022 I worked for Microsoft in Canada as a Software Engineer and I gained more clarity on what I want to do and how I want to live life. Consequently, I quit that job and I took the great opportunity to work on a project that shares my views, [Hubble Protocol](https://hubbleprotocol.io/), where I am humbled by the mission and the brightness of my colleagues on a daily basis.

### Tech interests


As time passes and I am getting older, I become more and more interested in how tech can be used to preserve our freedom and democracy in the tough times that seem to come. Descentralisation, zero-knowledge systems, encryptions and finance are my current main areas of interests, especially by seeing how they are connected to real world and how we can leverage these values and the tech around it at Hubble. I am a beginner in all of those and I just try to make sense of them and learn the fundamentals.
Besides that, I am interested in [video compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression#Video) and streaming, for which I am very grateful to the teams in Twitter where I was an intern, [Magic Pony](https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/20/twitter-is-buying-magic-pony-technology-which-uses-neural-networks-to-improve-images/) and Media Platform, who introduced me to this area and taught me almost everything I know in this realm. They gave me the chance to work and gain insights on both client-side, on problems such as bandwidth estimation, [adaptive streaming algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_bitrate_streaming), live streams, but also on the server-side on [subjective quality analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_video_quality), [video transcoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcoding) and [transmuxing](https://blog.stackpath.com/transmuxing/), metrics and performance, etc. <br/>
Also, I am interested in [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and [Computer Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) and how this can be used on video problems such as no reference QoE analysis, bandwidth estimation and distribution, compression, but also in other cross-discipline problems such as [SLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping). I would say that generally the problem of AGI and intelligence amazes me both from a philosophical and applied point of view.<br/>

### Personal interests

On Champions League nights you can find me cheering for Liverpool and Real Madrid, and in the remaining spare time I enjoy playing football and basketball, watch UFC and getting lost on Twitter threads. Also, in my headphones, you can always find a podcast or [rap music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RMjo51fEp8), interrupted by me speaking about any of the topics from above, but also about the future, start-up and research ideas or simply overthink about life scenarios in my head.
