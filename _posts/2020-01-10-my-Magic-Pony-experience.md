## Context and recruiting
In the summer of 2018 I was a software engineer intern at Twitter London, in the Media Client Infrastructure team. The hiring process began with my application on the Twitter website; after that, they sent a coding challenge which involve 2 quite easy algorithmic questions and a SQL question.
After solving these questions and submitting them, nothing happened for around 3 months.
Suddenly, I got an email from Twitter's HR that they want to proceed to the next stage with my application, which was a semi-technical discussion with the team manager, [Johannes Totz](https://twitter.com/johannes_totz) and it was amazing: we spoke about Machine Learning, Signal Processing, Data Structures, what the team does and which are the challenges they are facing, etc. We didn't dive into a very technical discussion as my knowledge on all the areas mentioned above is very limited.
Following this, I had a technical (coding) interview with the man who became my mentor and teached me with great patience and shared with me a lot of knowledge about video engineering and iOS development, [Yordan Chaparov](https://twitter.com/ychaparov). He gave me a coding problem which was not very hard but required clean coding and thinking about the edge cases. Finally, I had another interview with Johannes and after that I got the formal offer.
Twitter was very flexible in terms of start and end date and it was very suitable for me, as I could take a break after University.

## The beginning of the story
I started the internship in the middle of June and I can remember very well the first day: I was confused by the London tube and as I lived close to the Bank station, I took the Central Line from Bank to Oxford Street, which is horribly busy and warm during summer, and then I had to walk the Regent Street, which I still find impressive and it is one of my favourite places in London, to reach the office.

The office is very central and Twitter has 2 floors of the building, which also have showers, parking, bikes parking and lockers, which makes it a very comfortable place, especially as I used to go to the gym in the morning. Besides that, Twitter provides breakfast, lunch, snacks and beverages for its employees and the food is amazing (shoutout to [JustEatMyTweet](https://twitter.com/JustEatMyTweet)). 
In the first day I got to meet my team and my mentor and I got a brief description about what the team does and what will be the project I will be working on, alongside the set-up for my laptop and the security, privacy, etc trainings.
In the first couple of weeks I got great materials and tutorials from the team and they spend a lot of time with me, teaching me the basics of the video streaming and how the mobile client works. This made me become very interested in video engineering and I feel that their contribution is priceless for my professional path; thanks a lot [Sebastian van Leuven]()
