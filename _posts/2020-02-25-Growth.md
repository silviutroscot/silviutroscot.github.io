# On growth
## Universes
This post is by far the most personal I've ever written. A lot of things happened lately. Things changed, in my world and in the outside world, as in my view for each of us there are two worlds: our world, which contain people and events we care about, and this universe is wide and contain family, friends, but also your role models, your favourite football or basketball team, a podcaster or the political party you support, and there is also an "external" world, made of people and events that don't matter to you and that are at most a thought crossing your mind.

My personal world changed sharply in the last months and I felt that it took me out of the confort zone and shaped me more into the man I want to become, both professional and personal. Looking backwards, I realise I have made a lot of mistakes and a significant part of them were due to the fact that I couldn't listen to my inner voice so I lost myself or I made decisions and actions based on fears and on my lack of self confidence.

Also, the external world changed a lot, but one step I made to becoming a better version of myself is to ignore this universe and don't let anything from it touch me in any way. 

## Pick your battles
Everything you read here it's just my opinion, and not even that, I'm not that smart. I listen to a pretty wide variety of people and I tried to embed in me the wisdom and perspectives I found inspiring, wise or motivational. Just to drop some names, I follow and think about the opinions and views of people such as [Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/naval), [Richard Feynman](https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman), [Lex Fridman](https://twitter.com/lexfridman), [Peter Thiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel), [Jordan Peterson](https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson), [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk), [Sam Harris](https://twitter.com/SamHarrisOrg), [Rachel Thomas](https://twitter.com/math_rachel), [Eric Weinstein](https://twitter.com/EricRWeinstein), [Conor McGregor](https://twitter.com/TheNotoriousMMA), [Kobe Bryant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSceuiPBpxY), [LeBron James](https://twitter.com/KingJames), [Suzan Polgar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wzs33wvr9E), [Jack Dorsey](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/15/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-eats-seven-meals-every-week-only-dinner.html), [George Carlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo-QIY7ys-k), [Joe Rogan](https://twitter.com/joerogan) and others. 

They are entrepreneurs, comedians, athletes, scientists, psychologists, but they are much more then that: they are parents, lovers, children, and many others. None of us are defined only by one side or activity of our life and it took me 22 years to understand that. We can grow in almost any aspect of our life, but it can be horribly painful. It will probably involve loosing sleep, people you love, dead ends and restarts, deception, maybe physical pain, but in the end, everything worths. During these journeys, even if I made all the possible mistakes, I start understanding myself and each part of me which grew brought me closer to the balanced man I want to be. In a conversation about style and clothes, one of my wisest friends explained me that her style flourished when she started understanding herself, and that should be my aim and the rest will come naturally. This person 

One of the main things I learnt from [Naval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44) is that first of all, one should pick their battle(s). 

## Mamba
Some of those people I follow and have as role models in different aspects of my life are not alive anymore, but it doesn't change a thing in the way I perceive them. They are always alive in my mind and memories and this is how probably everyone perceives their heroes like this. Kobe's death was wery impactful for my world, as he is one of my heroes and especially after he retired we could see other parts of him: a great father and husband and a man willing to do everything to inspire others in becoming a better version of themselves. 

Everytime I speak about Kobe, I remember what he said about his career and life: "I did everything I could so at the end of my career I will have no regrets about what I could have been" and looking inside me, this is the major thing that guides me: minimize the regrets. But focusing on that without an emotional balance can be misguiding and 

## The end
I think there is no end. Nothing ends, the impact of that event or that person just become more subtle and the implications in your life and in the real world are more difficult to be associated with that.
