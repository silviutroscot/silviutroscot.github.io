# On growth
## Universes
A lot of things happened lately. Things changed, in my world and in the outside world, as in my view for each of us there are two worlds: our world, which contain people and events we care about, and this universe is wide and contain family, friends, but also your role models, your favourite football or basketball team, a podcaster or the political party you support, and there is also an "external" world, made of people and events that don't matter to you and that are at most a thought crossing your mind.

My personal world changed sharply in the last months and I felt that it took me out of the confort zone and shaped me more into the man I want to become, both professional and personal. Looking backwards, I realise I have made a lot of mistakes and a significant part of them were due to the fact that I couldn't listen to my inner voice so I lost myself or I made decisions and actions based on fears and on my lack of self confidence.

Also, the external world changed a lot, but one step I made to becoming a better version of myself is to ignore this universe and don't let anything from it touch me in any way. 

## Pick your battles
Everything you read here it's just my opinion, and not even that, I'm not that smart. I listen to a pretty wide variety of people and I tried to embed in me the wisdom and perspectives I found inspiring, wise or motivational. Just to drop some names, I follow and think about the opinions and views of people such as [Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/naval), [Richard Feynman](https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman), [Lex Fridman](https://twitter.com/lexfridman), [Peter Thiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel), [Jordan Peterson](https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson), [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk), [Sam Harris](https://twitter.com/SamHarrisOrg), [Rachel Thomas](https://twitter.com/math_rachel), [Eric Weinstein](https://twitter.com/EricRWeinstein), [Conor McGregor](https://twitter.com/TheNotoriousMMA), [Kobe Bryant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSceuiPBpxY), [LeBron James](https://twitter.com/KingJames), [Suzan Polgar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wzs33wvr9E), [Jack Dorsey](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/15/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-eats-seven-meals-every-week-only-dinner.html), [George Carlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo-QIY7ys-k), [Joe Rogan](https://twitter.com/joerogan) and others. 

One of the main things I learnt from [Naval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44) is that first of all, one should pick their battle(s). 

## The end
I think there is no end. Nothing ends, its impact just become more subtle and the implications in your life and in the real world are more difficult to be associated with a person or an event.
