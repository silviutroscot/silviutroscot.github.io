Well..everyone has a blog, so why one more around? Why are you writing down stuff on a blog?
The answer for that is very selfish: I want to improve the way I present and explain different things 
happening in my mind, to learn how to structure my speech and ideas and to use more suitable words.<br/>
Besides that, I strongly believe in what Feynman said, "If you want to master something, teach it.", so 
the main focus of this blog is to explain as good and simple as I can, various concepts and ideas I try to learn. These will be mostly about video engineering, signal processing, AI/ML, computer vision and maths, 
but whenever I will be curious in something else, I will try to explain it here. Maybe you'll find it useful,
but the main goal is to find gaps in my understanding and to embed it in my brain.

### So this blog is for you, why should I read it?

My aim on this blog is to explain in the best way I can some parts of the realms I am interested about
and eventually to see and show the connections between them can be made. Given my theoretical background,
I will try to provide a very theoretical approach but also some intuition on the problem or idea explained,
so if this topic is in your area of interest you can gain a better understanding, and if this isn't something interesting maybe it will make you think "hmm, that's really interesting, let's learn more about this".<br/>
On my way to teach things in order to improve my understanding, I decided with my friend Mihai Bujanca to start a course on Machine Learning and Computer Vision (both geometrical and ML approaches). We will release the first lectures and labs soon, and we are waiting for feedback and suggestions.
