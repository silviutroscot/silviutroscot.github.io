### Background

Borned in [Ramnicu-Sarat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A2mnicu_S%C4%83rat), Romania, where I lived for 18 years and I developed my interest in sciences and maths, but also in football, politics and lifting weights.<br/>
Since 2016 I started studying Computer Science at [The University of Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Manchester) and I was intern at Seers CRM, Twitter, Bloomberg and Microsoft, where I gained a better image of the tech industry and I had the chance to work with great engineers.<br/>
Currently I am in the last year of the University and I am looking with curiosity to what the future will bring.

### Tech interests

My main interests are [video compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression#Video) and streaming, for which I am very grateful to the teams in Twitter where I was an intern, [Magic Pony](https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/20/twitter-is-buying-magic-pony-technology-which-uses-neural-networks-to-improve-images/) and Media Platform, who introduced me to this area and taught me almost everything I know in this realm. They gave me the chance to work and gain insights on both client side, on problems such as bandwidth estimation, [adaptive streaming algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_bitrate_streaming), live streams, but also on the server side on [subjective quality analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_video_quality), [video transcoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcoding) and [transmuxing](https://blog.stackpath.com/transmuxing/), metrics and performance, etc. <br/>
Lately I became interested in [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and [Computer Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) and how this can be used on video problems such as no reference QoE analysis, bandwidth estimation and distribution, compression, but also in other cross discipline problems such as [SLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping).<br/>
Besides that, I am interested in large scale and distributed systems and how to increase the performance and scale of the software I write.

### Personal interests

On Champions League nights you can find me cheering for Liverpool and Real Madrid, and in the remaining spare time I enjoy playing football and basketball, lift heavy weights, binge watch Netflix shows and stand up specials. Also, in my headphones you can always find a podcast or rap music, interrupted by me speaking about any of the topics from above, but also about the future, start-up and research ideas or simply overthink about life scenarios in my head :(
